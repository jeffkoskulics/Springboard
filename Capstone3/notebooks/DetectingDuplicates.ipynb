    "# Detecting Duplicates\n",
    "In the previous EDA step, we found signs of numerous duplicated tweets. Some of the text strings are exactly identical. These can be dropped using Pandas `drop_duplicates` method. Others are more difficult. Some contain different hashtags and handles. Others have slightly different punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll detect duplicates by measuring the similarity between strings. The basic approach is to clean the text (removing punctuation, stopwords, hashtags and handles), vectorize each string using a word count vectorizer, and measure the cosine angle between vectors. Pairs of sentences with the smallest cosine angle are good candidates for being duplicates."
